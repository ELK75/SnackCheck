<p align="center" font-size="20px"><b >Goal</b></p>

  These days every is on a different diet whether it is due to allergens, health restrictions, or specific preferences.  A friend of ours has celiac disease and has always wanted a central location to find recipes that don't have gluten. Through this idea, we created SnackCheck. Our goal is to create a central location for people with dietary restrictions such as celiac disease, veganism, or allergies to find recipes tailored to their diet.
