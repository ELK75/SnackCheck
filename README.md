## SnackCheck

### Goal

  These days every is on a different diet whether it is due to allergens, health restrictions, or specific preferences.  A friend of ours has celiac disease and has always wanted a central location to find recipes that don't have gluten. Through this idea, we created SnackCheck. Our goal is to create a central location for people with dietary restrictions such as celiac disease, veganism, or allergies to find recipes tailored to their diet.

### Description

  Our app allows users to find a list of recipes that they can cook based on their dietary restrictions.  Simply select your restrictions/needs and our app will generate a list of recipes that adhere to it.
